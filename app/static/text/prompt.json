    "prompt" : "It has been nearly three months since the University of Southern California was overtaken by hostile forces and subsequently recaptured by the Airmen of Troy. As the Airmen of Troy recaptured their home at USC, the enemy retreated to the University of California, Los Angeles. During the past three months, the Bruins have attempted time after time to recapture their home but have (unsurprisingly) failed to do so. As a result of their desperation, they have called upon the Airmen of Troy to reclaim their stolen home. It is now up to the Airmen of Troy to lend a hand to their long time rivals to defeat a common enemy. Your team must navigate the unfamiliar Bruin campus to remove the vast number of hostile anti-aircraft systems, establish forward operating bases, and rescue prisoners of war. The enemy are known to plant a large number of traps and set ambushes. It is likely your team will encounter resistance along the way."
